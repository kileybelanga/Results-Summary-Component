## My process
I started out by organizing my sementic structure and once I had each element organized into their group I began styling working from the outermost layer inwards. Once styles I reviewed my stylesheet and html to see where I could improve and streamline my code. After styling for desktop I started working on responsiveness and styling for mobile. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that a lot goes into styling just one single component on a page and that to be most efficent you need to determine at what point will applying the style of the element be most effective and efficent.

I am still learning to get a hang of flexboxes and how they are used and how they further apply to elements within them.
  - I ended up restructuring my code some to better utilize the effects of flexboxes divs within the sections. 

I was concerned with styling individual characters in paragraph tags, but a quick google search introduced me to the <span> tag.


### Continued development

I am very interested in furthering my education on flexboxes so that I have a better understanding on how they effect different elements underneath them. I would also be interested in how I would implement grids instead of flexbox on a design like this.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I continuously reference this guide whenever I am working in flexbox while I am still getting comfortable with how it works.
